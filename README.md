This is a full detailed code on how to clean data, feature importance, data visualisation, data fitting, model making and model saving from scratch. This code is used to train an Ada boosting model for "body fat predictions" by using measurements of one's body. here the accuracy is a bit low as data only contained 190 datapoint and the data was very seperated. The Datset is good by it can add 2 features (Gender- as male, female and trans have different body proportions ) and ( region - as different regions have different body proportions genitically).If you have any questions please ask and i am preparing the web application (frontend) of this application as well and till then if i find a better dataset i will replace the files for a better accuracy.
